## CCJS 200 - Statistics for Criminology & Criminal Justice (Spring 2024)

### Course Syllabus

* Course description (from the University catalog): Introduction to descriptive and inferential statistics, graphical techniques, and the computer analysis of criminology and criminal justice data. Basic procedures of hypothesis testing, correlation and regression analysis, and the analysis of continuous and binary dependent variables. Emphasis upon the examination of research problems and issues in criminology and criminal justice.
* Meetings: This course is scheduled to meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 11-12:15pm in LeFrak 2205 and I plan to hold office hours on Tuesdays from 1-2:30pm and by appointment (you can email me at rbrame@umd.edu). My office is 2139 LeFrak Hall.
* Graduate Teaching Assistants: Jae Eun (Jane) Lee (jelee18@umd.edu) and Jordan Pierce (jmpierce@umd.edu); they will each be holding their own office hours (Jordan on Monday from 1-2 and Jane on Wednesday from 1-2) and will also be responsible for overseeing discussion sections which will meet on Fridays (please see your registration information to identify your section).  Their office is 2163 LeFrak Hall
* Course-related policies: In all matters, I will follow University guidance as outlined [here](https://www.ugst.umd.edu/courserelatedpolicies.html).
* Accessibility accommodations: As a matter of University policy, I do my best to abide by all recommended accommodations. If you think you might need one or more academic accommodations, please contact the Accessibility and Disability Service Office ([link](https://ads.umd.edu)) for guidance and assistance.
* Email policy: Please refrain from sending messages to us (me, Jane, and Jordan) on ELMS. We ask that you email us directly at our UMD email addresses listed above.
* Required Textbook: Bachman, Paternoster, and Wilson (2022, 5th edition), *Statistics for Criminology and Criminal Justice*. 
* Class Notes: the class notes will be posted on this webpage.
* Letter grades: At the end of the semester, letter grades will be assigned on a 100-point scale (A+ = 97 and higher; A = 93-96; A- = 90-92; B+ = 87-89; B = 83-86; B- = 80-82; C+ = for 77-79; C = 73-76; C- = 70-72; D+ = 67-69; D = 63-66; D- = 60-62; and F = any grade less than 60). All numeric grades (including the final numeric grade in the class at the end of the semester) will be rounded off to the nearest 1 point (for example, a 78.5 would be rounded to a 79 and a 78.4 would be rounded to a 78).
* Numeric grades in this class will be based on 3 in-class exams and 3 out-of-class assignments and will all be graded on a 100-point scale. The final numeric grade calculation at the end of the semester will be: 0.25 x Exam 1 + 0.25 x Exam 2 + 0.25 x Exam 3 + 0.25 x Average Assignment Grade. (Addendum: there will also be a second formula: 0.2 x Exam 1 + 0.2 x Exam 2 + 0.2 x Exam 3 + 0.4 x Average Assignment Grade. At the end of the semester, I will calculate your grade using both approaches and I will assign your grade based on the formula that gives you the higher grade). Any formulas needed for exams will be printed on the exam.
* Key dates: (1) first class day - Thursday 1/25; (2) spring break - 3/19-3/21; (3) last day of class - Thursday 5/9; and (4) scheduled final exam period - Saturday May 11th from 8-10am.
* Attendance expectations: My expectation is that you will attend all of the class and discussion sessions (unless you are sick or have some other good reason not to attend). If you have to miss a class or a discussion section, I encourage you to work with other people in the class to get caught up on your notes and contact me or the TA's if you ever need clarification or assistance. If you have to miss an exam, we will follow the notification and make-up policies specified by the University.
* Statistical software: As noted in the catalog description, there must be a computer component to this course. We will be using R, which is free, easy to get, and works on both Windows and Mac computers.

#### Answers to Important Questions (still part of the syllabus)

* Why do I have to take this course?

The University of Maryland has a General Education curriculum [(link)](https://gened.umd.edu/node/35) which all baccalaureate-level degree recipients must complete. Part of this curriculum is called Fundamental Studies and successful completion of this course (CCJS 200) satisfies the Fundamental Studies Analytic Reasoning (FSAR) requirement. So, when you see FSAR labels associated with this course, that is what those labels refer to. The Analytic Reasoning requirement expresses a belief among the University faculty that analytic reasoning is an essential part of what it means to have received a liberal arts education.

* What does UMD expect us to cover in a class that satisfies the University's analytic reasoning requirement?

According to the Gen-Ed [website](https://gened.umd.edu/students/four-categories/fundamental-studies), "[c]courses in Analytic Reasoning foster a student's ability to use mathematical or formal methods or structured protocols and patterns of reasoning to examine problems or issues by evaluating evidence, examining proofs, analyzing relationships between variables, developing arguments, and drawing conclusions appropriately. Courses in this category advance and build upon the skills that students develop in Fundamental Mathematics."

* Why is this course taught in the CCJS department?

The disciplinary focus of this course reflects a belief by the faculty that analytic reasoning skills can be effectively conveyed through the disciplinary lens of the student's major. The alternative would be to teach a course like this in a math or statistics department and, indeed, this is what is done at some universities. There is no right or wrong way to deliver this kind of course; what we have at Maryland reflects the views of the faculty who work here.

* I don't like math and I'm apprehensive about taking this course. Can you help me feel better about this?

It just so happens that when criminologists do research and evaluation work, they often rely on quantitative data and so it came to pass that we have this class which emphasizes "statistical analysis." Even though you will be performing some calculations and working with some numeric data in this class, the calculations you will be doing are probably best viewed as "arithmetic" (which is a subset of the field of mathematics). This is to emphasize that all of the calculating in this class will be focused on addition, substraction, multiplication, and division -- in other words, skills with which you're pretty familiar. In addition, each chapter of the textbook has practice problems at the end of the chapter with answers to the odd-numbered exercises at the back of the book. I encourage you to build confidence in your ability to solve problems by working on the exercises that coincide with the material we cover in class (please note: we won't address every single topic that is discussed in the book so you should only work on practice problems that are consistent with the class material). As preparation, you are also encouraged to work on the practice arithmetic problems in Appendix A at the back of the textbook. Your discussion sections and office hours are the appropriate venue for getting help with the practice problems. The University also offers the [Math Success Program](https://tltc.umd.edu/students/get-help-class/math-success-program) which may be helpful to you.

* What are the pre-requisites for this class?

You need to have completed CCJS 100 (Intro to Criminal Justice) *or* CCJS 105 (Intro to Criminology); *and* you need to have attained a grade of C- or better in STAT 100 (Elementary Statistics and Probability), MATH 107 (Introduction to Math Modeling and Probability), MATH 120 (Elementary Calculus I), or MATH 135 (Calculus I). Less common, but still acceptable, courses include MATH 111 or MATH 130. If you haven't met these requirements, you should *drop this class now* and return when they've been completed.

* What will I be able to do when this course is over?

These are the course learning outcomes which I have defined as your being able to: (1) explain the meaning, limitations, and calculation of commonly used statistics related to crime and criminal justice; (2) distinguish between descriptive and inferential analysis and how tools in both domains are used to advance knowledge about crime and criminal justice; (3) analyze certain kinds of quantitative criminological evidence, considering both the strengths and weaknesses of methodological approaches often used in our discipline; and (4) perform basic statistical calculations related to criminologically interesting phenomena. 

* What will the assignments and exams be like in this class?

You will have 3 out-of-class assignments in this course; each assignment will consist of substantive and computer-related applications of key concepts taught in class. You will have 1 week to complete each of the out-of-class assignments. Also, each of the assignments will be posted on this webpage and will be submitted on ELMS at or before 11:59pm on the due date (if you submit after 11:59pm on the due date, there will be a 3-point per hour deduction on your assignment grade). All assignments should be submitted in pdf format (3-point deduction for assignments not submitted in pdf format). Exams will involve pencil and paper problems and calculations. For these exams, you will need to have a calculator which can take square roots. You will be able to use your paper notes (no books, phones, or computers) on the exam but we will provide all needed formulas on the exam itself so you will not need to spend any time looking up formulas. On exam days, the full class period will be devoted to the exam. For both out-of-class assignments and exams, you must show us your work in order to receive full credit. In cases where you provide an answer without showing the underlying work (or, when applicable, the relevant computer script and output), you will only receive one-half credit. Similarly, if you get an incorrect answer to a question or problem but you show your work, you will receive partial credit for the work that was done correctly.

* What happens in discussion sections?

Jane and Jordan will be the CCJS 200 teaching assistants this semester and they will oversee the discussion sections each Friday. Both of them are well versed in the concepts and materials we are discussing this semester. During the discussion sections, Jane and Jordan will be answering lecture- and assignment-related questions; they will also go over practice problems at the end of the textbook chapters. They are a valuable resource for you this semester and I encourage you to fully engage with the discussion section each week. 

* How do I get and use R?

R is available at this [website](https://www.r-project.org). You can read about the history of R (it was originally developed at Bell Labs and used to be called S and then S+) at the Wikipedia [page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)). To work with R, you will need to use a plain text editor (Notepad on Windows or TextEdit on Macs) or a program like RStudio. I will be going over the basics in class; Jane and Jordan will go over RStudio in the discussion sections. R and RStudio are both available on the OACS ([website](https://oacs.umd.edu/facilities/oacs-computer-labs)) and McKeldin PC's ([website](https://umd.app.box.com/s/6gtvcfbos7x837wlvsf2denyrvghs5w6)).

#### Lesson 2 - Tuesday 1/30/24

* Assigned Reading: Chapter 1 (continued).
* Update on course grading: I've decided that at the end of the semester, I will calculate your grades two different ways. The first way will assign 25% weight to each of your exams and 25% weight to the average of your assignment grades. That is what is presented in the syllabus. Second, however, I will calculate your grade assigning 20% weight to each of your exams and 40% weight to the average of your assignment grades. I will assign your final letter grade based on the higher grade out of these 2 calculations.
